# Stephen — Phase 2 progress

_Last updated: 2026-07-27_

## Current state

- P2-0 persistent content runs/SSE: **merged** in PR #32.
- Task 4 parameter sandbox: **merged** in PR #33 after eight security review
  rounds.
- Task 5 parameter serving/config: **next, assigned to Claude**.
- Admin Console v0: **planned, assigned to Codex**.

Admin v0 is Stephen-owned staging enablement. Saurav does not need to confirm
or stop his own work; this status is the requested informational handoff so
his agent can avoid claimed files.

## Two-agent split

Claude continues Phase 2 Task 5 and owns the parameterization paths it records
in
[`coordination/CLAUDE.md`](coordination/CLAUDE.md).

Codex owns Admin Console v0 and records its paths in
[`coordination/CODEX.md`](coordination/CODEX.md). The implementation plan is
[`2026-07-27-admin-console-v0-stephen.md`](2026-07-27-admin-console-v0-stephen.md).

Each agent edits only its own claim file. Both read both files before editing.
Student Preview waits for Task 5 to release `serving.service.ts` and
`attempts.service.ts`; the Admin account/provisioning slice may proceed in
parallel once Claude publishes an exact, non-overlapping claim.

## Admin v0 decisions

- Admins grant a global `platformInstructor` capability by CWL username.
- Pre-login grants are pending records keyed by normalized CWL `uid`; no fake
  PUID-backed User is created.
- Platform Instructor authorizes the Instructor shell and course creation;
  existing-course access remains course-scoped.
- Student Preview uses separate Instructor-only endpoints and does not weaken
  `ensureCourseStudent()`.
- Preview of unpublished courses still serves approved questions only.
- Preview records are structurally separate from live attempts and cannot
  affect mastery, Review Book, flags, remediation, summaries, notifications,
  or analytics.

## Message for Saurav

No action is required. Please treat the paths in both coordination ledgers as
reserved while their state is active. Task 5 completion remains the unblock
signal for Saurav's Task 9; Admin v0 does not change the Task 5 parameter
contract.
